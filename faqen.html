						<span>Another url-shortener?</span>
						<p>yepp. :)</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>Ok. So what's so special about this one?</span>

							<ul class="bullets">
								<li>It's free</li>
								<li>It's ad-free</li>
								<li>It doesn't collect personal data</li>
								<li>It offers statistics</li>
								<li>It can expire</li>
								<li>It allows custom urls</li>
							</ul><p></p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>Ha! Others are free, too!</span>
						<p>Damn. You're right. Must have missed that.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>personal data?</span>
						<p>Other sites collect not only your personal data, but also that of others visiting your url. We don't</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>But how can you show statistics without personal data?</span>
						<p>We count. That's it. We don't know you, we don't care where you come from or what you like. We just know anybody visited that site. </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>Expiration? Is it of any use?</span>
						<p>Good question. If it isn't for you: Just ignore it :)</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>custom urls? Cool.</span>
						<p>Right. But they must be at least five characters long</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>What about nasty words?</span>
						<p>We don't care.  </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>And if I don't like an address?</span>
						<p>Live with it. We just redirect. Don't tell us, tell the target's provider.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>So I may link to any site?</span>
						<p>Nope. Don't do anything illegal or racist. Your adress might be deleted otherwise</p>
					</li>
					<li><span>This site is ugly on my smartphone</span></li>
					<p>we know that. Response design is on our wish-list :)</p>
					<li><span>I have more questions</span></li>
