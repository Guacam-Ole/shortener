##Another url-shortener?
yepp. :)

##Ok. So what's so special about this one?
- It's free
- It's ad-free
- It doesn't collect personal data
- It offers statistics
- It can expire
- It allows custom urls
>Ha! Others are free, too!
Damn. You're right. Must have missed that.

##personal data?
Other sites collect not only your personal data, but also that of others visiting your url. We don't

##But how can you show statistics without personal data?
We count. That's it. We don't know you, we don't care where you come from or what you like. We just know anybody visited that site.

##Expiration? Is it of any use?
Good question. If it isn't for you: Just ignore it :)

##custom urls? Cool.
Right. But they must be at least five characters long

##What about nasty words?
We don't care.

##And if I don't like an address?
Live with it. We just redirect. Don't tell us, tell the target's provider.

##So I may link to any site?
Nope. Don't do anything illegal or racist. Your adress might be deleted otherwise

##This site is ugly on my smartphone
we know that. Response design is on our wish-list :)
