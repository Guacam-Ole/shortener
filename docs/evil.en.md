# Don't be evil
Most likely you aren't evil but whoever sent you this URL seems to be trying something really, really bad. 

The page that you were trying to open was marked as Phising, Malware or simply evil. If you never opened the site before: Don't worry. We took care of that and show you this page instead.

## Oh-Oh
If you already opened that url before and entered personal data or even critical passwords: Change your passwords, contact the real site that you were trying to access.

## How could this happen?
We try to check every url that is entered into fade.at. But we can only block urls that is already saved in the safebrowsing-Database

## Need more help?
Have a look at https://safebrowsing.google.com/ There you can also tell them if you think this was a false alarm.
